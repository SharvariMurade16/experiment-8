### AIM
To create a matrix by taking inputs from user and doing operations on it.

### Software Used
VS Code

### Problem Statement
1.) To make a matrix by taking number of rows and column from user.

2.) To make a matrix by taking number of rows and column from user and do their addition and multiplication.

3.) To add the diagonal elements of the matrix.

4.) To make the transpose of a matrix.

## Theory
What is a Matrix?
A matrix is like a grid or table where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. Think of it like a game board where each cell holds a number.

Matrix Addition
To add two matrices, they must be the same size (same number of rows and columns). You simply add the number in each cell of the first matrix to the number in the same cell of the second matrix. For example, if one matrix has the number 1 in a cell and the other has 2 in the same cell, the result will be 3.

Matrix Multiplication
Multiplying matrices is a bit more complicated. You need to make sure that the number of columns in the first matrix is the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. The result is a new matrix where each number is calculated by combining numbers from rows in the first matrix with columns in the second matrix in a special way.

Diagonal Elements
In a square matrix (where the number of rows and columns is the same), there are two main diagonals:
Main Diagonal: Runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
Secondary Diagonal: Runs from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. Diagonal elements are just the numbers found along these lines.
Transpose of a Matrix

To transpose a matrix, you flip it over its diagonal. This means turning the rows into columns and columns into rows. So if the original matrix has numbers arranged in a certain way, the transposed matrix will have those numbers rearranged so that the first row becomes the first column, the second row becomes the second column, and so on.
